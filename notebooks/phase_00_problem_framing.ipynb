    "# Phase 0 — Problem Framing (Time Series Regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "Energy operators need reliable **hourly production forecasts** to support:\n",
    "- grid stability and load balancing\n",
    "- short-term capacity planning\n",
    "- smoother integration of renewables (where variability is high)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project treats forecasting as a *real-world ML system problem* — not just a leaderboard exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Given historical, time-ordered observations of energy production and contextual signals, **predict the energy produced for each hour** while strictly respecting temporal order (no shuffling, no leakage).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task type:** Supervised learning → **Regression** (continuous target)  \n",
    "**Data type:** Tabular **time series** (each row = one timestamp/hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Variable\n",
    "- **`Production`** → continuous numeric value representing energy produced during a specific hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs (Features)\n",
    "The dataset contains:\n",
    "- **Temporal signals:** timestamp-derived variables (hour / day-of-year / month / day name / season)\n",
    "- **Categorical context:** e.g., **energy source** (Wind, etc.) and seasonal labels\n",
    "\n",
    "> Key rule: since time drives the structure, features and evaluation must respect chronology.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forecasting Setup (What “Good” Looks Like)\n",
    "A good model should:\n",
    "- generalize to *future* periods (not memorize past patterns)\n",
    "- remain stable across different time windows (not just one lucky split)\n",
    "- avoid hidden leakage through preprocessing or feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metric (Why RMSE)\n",
    "Primary metric: **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  \n",
    "RMSE is chosen because:\n",
    "- it’s standard for continuous forecasting\n",
    "- it penalizes large misses heavily (important in energy planning)\n",
    "- it is easy to compare across models and phases\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation Strategy (Leakage-Safe)\n",
    "Because this is time series:\n",
    "- data must be split **chronologically**\n",
    "- no random shuffling\n",
    "- the **test set is used once** at the end (final unbiased check)\n",
    "\n",
    "Split policy used in this project:\n",
    "- **70% train / 15% validation / 15% test** (time-ordered)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Deliverables\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will produce:\n",
    "- a leakage-safe ML pipeline (preprocessing + modeling)\n",
    "- baseline benchmarks (so improvements are meaningful)\n",
    "- feature engineering designed for forecasting (lags/rolling stats with shifting)\n",
    "- model comparisons using validation RMSE\n",
    "- error analysis explaining *where and why* the model fails (peaks, seasons, hours, sources)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology Snapshot\n",
    "The workflow progresses in phases:\n",
    "1. framing + metric + constraints\n",
    "2. data sanity + EDA\n",
    "3. time-aware splitting\n",
    "4. baselines\n",
    "5. preprocessing pipelines\n",
    "6. feature engineering (lags/rolling)\n",
    "7. advanced models\n",
    "8. error analysis + robustness\n",
    "9. conclusions + future work\n"
