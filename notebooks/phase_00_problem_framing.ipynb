    "# Energy Production Forecasting — Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The objective of this project is to **predict hourly energy production** using historical production data and time-based contextual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Variable\n",
    "- **`Production`**: Continuous numerical value representing energy produced during a specific hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nature of the Data\n",
    "- Tabular **time-series regression** dataset  \n",
    "- Each row corresponds to energy production at a given timestamp  \n",
    "- Contains both temporal features (date, hour, seasonality) and categorical context (energy source, season)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data is time-dependent, it is treated as a **time-series problem**, and random shuffling is avoided to prevent data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Relevance\n",
    "Accurate energy production forecasting is essential for:\n",
    "- grid stability and load balancing  \n",
    "- energy capacity planning  \n",
    "- efficient integration of renewable energy sources  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project mirrors real-world forecasting challenges faced by energy operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metric\n",
    "- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** is used as the primary evaluation metric, as it penalizes large prediction errors and is well-suited for continuous energy output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "- Build a robust time-series regression pipeline  \n",
    "- Compare baseline and machine learning models  \n",
    "- Apply meaningful feature engineering  \n",
    "- Use time-aware validation strategies  \n",
    "- Analyze **where and why models fail**, not just overall accuracy  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology Overview\n",
    "The modeling workflow followed in this project includes:\n",
    "- chronological train, validation, and test splitting to respect temporal order  \n",
    "- baseline model establishment for performance benchmarking  \n",
    "- preprocessing pipelines to prevent data leakage  \n",
    "- feature engineering using time-based and lag features  \n",
    "- model comparison and controlled hyperparameter tuning  \n",
    "- error and residual analysis to understand failure patterns and limitations  \n"
